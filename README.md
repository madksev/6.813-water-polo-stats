# 6813-project

TODO GR5
===
Simpler:
+ ~~(Mary) Close menu by clicking outside of it (not just X)~~
+ (Mary) label goalie, separate visually from other active players
+ (Mary) switch active player with goalie [could be confusing visually as is]
+ ~~(Mary) organize stat buttons with more white space~~
+ ~~(Maddie) Format time in log as mm:ss~~
+ (Maddie) log should resort by time if time is edited
+ ~~(Maddie) have separate column for number & name in log (improve alignment)~~
+ ~~(Maddie) visible scroll bar on log?~~
+ ~~(Maddie) Log header should not scroll with entries~~
+ ~~(Mary) cursor change on hover over buttons~~
+ ~~(Mary) make all cancel buttons red circle w/ white X~~
+ ~~(Mary) stat buttons color change (needs to be more visible)~~
+ ~~(Mary) View Bench button change color when bench open and on hover~~
+ ~~(Mary) more distinction between hover & selected buttons~~ different enough?

Longer:
+ ~~(Michael) Mark Location should be bigger & gray out screen~~
+ ~~(Michael) have cancel button for Mark Location (bottom center of pool)~~
+ (Michael) mark location on mouseup instead of click
+ ~~(Parker) Undo button for deleting log entry~~
+ ~~(Maddie) Edit log entries (make text box editable)~~
+ ~~(Maddie) log player exchanges~~
+ (Parker) Assist dialog box when mark shot/goal
+ (Michael) Add game clock display
+ (Michael) Add play-pause button next to clock (default is paused)
+ Animation for switching players from bench to active
+ (if time) drag & drop to switch players
+ (if time) slide to delete like alarms on iPhone

For GR5 Presentation:
===
+ like the pool as is, don't need extra space for anything else
+ sorting the log by player/action is for viewing stats, not logging them
+ clear all log button is a safety issue
+ red/green color combo bad for color blind users, but we have the players in separate rows so it's OK
+ log switching sides suggested, but that only happens at half, and we included that button for visual feedback more than anything
