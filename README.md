TODO GR5
===
Simple:
+ (Mary) Close menu by clicking outside of it (not just X)
+ (Mary) make all cancel buttons red circle w/ white X
+ (Mary) label goalie, separate visually from other players
+ (Mary) switch active player with goalie?
+ (Mary) stat buttons color change (needs to be more visible)
+ (Mary) more distinction between hover & selected buttons
+ (Mary) cursor change on hover over buttons
+ (Maddie) visible scroll bar on log?
+ (Maddie) Format time in log as mm:ss
+ (Maddie) Log header should not scroll with entries
+ (Maddie) log should resort by time if time is edited

Long:
+ (Michael) Mark Location should be bigger & gray out screen
+ (Michael) have cancel button for Mark Location (bottom center of pool)
+ (Michael) mark location on mouseup instead of click
+ (Parker) Undo button for deleting log entry
+ (Maddie) Edit log entries (make text box editable)
+ Assist dialog box when mark shot/goal
+ Add game clock display
+ Add play-pause button next to clock (default is paused)
+ Animation for switching players from bench to active
+ (if time) drag & drop to switch players

For GR5 Presentation:
===
+ like the pool as is, don't need extra space for anything else
+ sorting the log by player/action is for viewing stats, not logging them
+ clear all log button is a safety issue
